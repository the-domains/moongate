      The scene backstage last November at the American Music Awards, that
      annual gathering of pop perennials and idiosyncratic arrivistes, was
      carnivalesque: Niall and Liam of One Direction toddled about trying to
      snap a picture with a selfie stick, while Zayn, their bandmate at the
      time, smoked coolly out of frame; Ne-Yo was there in a leopard-Â­print
      blazer two sizes too small; Lil Wayne was wandering around, alone, wearing
      absurd shoes.

  Published Mar 14, 2016 at 8:00 am (Updated Mar 14, 2016 at 7:28 am) The back
  of singer Joy Barnum's neck often hurts after a performance. It's from
  laughing and smiling so much. She kicks the stereotype of a sombre, stern
  opera singer right to the kerb.
