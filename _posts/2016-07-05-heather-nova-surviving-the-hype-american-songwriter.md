      The scene backstage last November at the American Music Awards, that
      annual gathering of pop perennials and idiosyncratic arrivistes, was
      carnivalesque: Niall and Liam of One Direction toddled about trying to
      snap a picture with a selfie stick, while Zayn, their bandmate at the
      time, smoked coolly out of frame; Ne-Yo was there in a leopard-Â­print
      blazer two sizes too small; Lil Wayne was wandering around, alone, wearing
      absurd shoes.

  Very often, when a female artist gets assigned the appellation of Next Big
  Thing, she paints on the Maybelline, does videos and talk shows, snags a cameo
  in a film and invents some sort of foul-smelling fragrance. When the
  lavishly-gifted Heather Nova got hit with such hype in the nineties, she
  simply put her head down and worked.
